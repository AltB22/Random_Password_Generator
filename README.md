# Random_Password_Generator

## Project Description: Create Web Application to generate a random passowrd

- The goal of this project was to create a web application for company employees to randomly generate a password to protect their sensitive and proprietary information.
- The project solves for the issue of ensuring a random nature to employee passwords rather than human selected common words or phrases.
- HTHL content was pre-existing (except for my linking of a reset.css file) and includes a button labeled "Generate Password" and a blank field to display the randomly generated output.(see screenshot)
- The CSS styling was pre-existing.  This project included adding a reset.css file to the assets directory.
- This project cosisted primarily of modification and elaboration of the JavaScript code to ensure that the application requires the user via a series of pronmpts and alerts to select a password length of between 8-128 characters, and to select at least one of the following character types: numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.
- Upon satisfaction of all the password criteria, the randomly generated password is displayed in the empty field inside the box.
